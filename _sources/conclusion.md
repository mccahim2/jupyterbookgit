# Conclusions

As part of this assignment the task was to perform K-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning method on the data provided as part of the Iowa gambling task. The research as part of this assignment allowed to find various features about the data during the data exploration phase. As part of the clustering phase of this assignment

### Data Analysis conclusions
The first conclusion that stuck out was the fact that deck 2 was the most selected deck out of all the decks. Deck 2 was considered to be a "bad" deck and reward less compared to decks 3 and 4.

### K-means Clustering conclusions


### Future work
The data that is used as part of this experiment can be very beneficial. It could be used as training data for "helathy" participants for similar projects in the future. It would be interesting to see how a predictive model works for a psychological experiment like this.
